# Security Checklist

Select checks for the trust boundaries, data and dependencies affected by the task, using `security-and-hardening` when needed. Keep actual project security/release requirements. Unrelated sections are not new work, and this reference does not authorize installation, destructive actions or production access.

## Threat Modeling (Start Here)

For a changed sensitive boundary, identify the relevant assets and plausible abuse. Reuse the existing threat model. Use a structured method such as STRIDE when its complexity warrants one; a local safe fix does not need a timed exercise or new threat-model document:

- [ ] Affected trust boundaries identified (requests, uploads, webhooks, third-party APIs, LLM output, or values written by untrusted processes)
- [ ] Assets at risk identified (credentials, PII, payment data, admin actions, money movement)
- [ ] Plausible threats examined at the affected boundary; STRIDE is an optional prompt for missed categories, not a required separate pass
- [ ] Important abuse cases inform implementation and relevant tests; record only decisions needed for review or continuation

## Pre-Commit Checks

For a change being prepared for authorized Git delivery, inspect its actual diff and use existing secret checks. These checks do not require staging or committing merely to inspect work.

- [ ] No credentials or private values added to source, examples, output or logs; avoid printing discovered secret values
- [ ] Secret-bearing local files are excluded under the project policy (for example `.env`, `.env.local`, private keys)
- [ ] `.env.example` uses placeholder values (not real secrets)

## Authentication

For changed authentication/session flows, preserve the established security policy and test relevant allowed/denied behavior. Do not migrate unrelated authentication configuration to match an example.

- [ ] Password storage uses an approved password-hashing library and project parameters, never plaintext or a fast general-purpose digest
- [ ] Session cookies retain appropriate `httpOnly`, `secure` and `sameSite` settings under the established session/CSRF policy. Preserve an approved `'lax'` or `'strict'` choice; an established cross-site `'none'` flow needs secure cookies and its actual CSRF protections, not a migration just to match an example
- [ ] Session expiration configured (reasonable max-age)
- [ ] Login abuse controls follow the project threat model and limits, with relevant denial/recovery behavior checked
- [ ] Password reset tokens are single-use with the project's justified expiry
- [ ] Account lockout after repeated failures (optional, with notification)
- [ ] MFA supported for sensitive operations (optional but recommended)

## Authorization

Check the affected protected operations and their real callers; preserve these invariants without reopening unrelated endpoints.

- [ ] Every protected endpoint checks authentication
- [ ] Every resource access checks ownership/role (prevents IDOR)
- [ ] Admin endpoints require admin role verification
- [ ] API keys scoped to minimum necessary permissions
- [ ] JWT tokens validated (signature, expiration, issuer)

## Input Validation

Select the boundary types changed by the task. Keep validation/encoding at the real trust boundary rather than adding unused parallel controls.

- [ ] All user input validated at system boundaries (API routes, form handlers)
- [ ] Validation uses allowlists (not denylists)
- [ ] String lengths constrained (min/max)
- [ ] Numeric ranges validated
- [ ] Email, URL, and date formats validated with proper libraries
- [ ] File uploads: type restricted, size limited, content verified
- [ ] SQL queries parameterized (no string concatenation)
- [ ] HTML output encoded (use framework auto-escaping)
- [ ] URLs validated before redirect (prevent open redirect)
- [ ] Server-side URL fetches allowlisted; private/reserved IPs blocked (prevent SSRF)
- [ ] Destructive path operations (delete/move/overwrite): symlinks resolved, allowlisted root, minimum depth, ownership evidence read before the call

### Destructive Path Operations

Containment for a target named by data. Resolve first, then decide — and treat the
result as a candidate, not as authorization:

```typescript
import { realpath, readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { resolve, relative, isAbsolute, join, sep } from 'node:path';

const ALLOWED_ROOTS = ['/var/lib/myapp/sessions']; // an allowlist, not a pattern
const MIN_DEPTH = 1;                               // so a root is never the target

async function resolveDeletable(candidate: string, expectedOwner: string) {
  const target = await realpath(resolve(candidate)); // symlinks resolved BEFORE the check
  const inRoot = ALLOWED_ROOTS.some((root) => {
    const rel = relative(root, target);
    // `rel === '..'` / `'../'` only — a plain `startsWith('..')` would also
    // reject a legitimate child named `..cache`.
    if (rel === '' || rel === '..' || rel.startsWith(`..${sep}`) || isAbsolute(rel)) return false;
    return rel.split(sep).length >= MIN_DEPTH;
  });
  if (!inRoot) throw new Error(`refusing: outside allowed roots (${target})`);

  const owner = await readFile(join(target, '.owner'), 'utf8').catch(() => null);
  if (owner?.trim() !== expectedOwner) throw new Error(`refusing: unproven owner (${target})`);
  return target;
}
```

What this does not do, and must be said where the snippet is copied from:

- **The marker is self-attestation.** Anything that can write inside the root can write
  `.owner`. `expectedOwner` has to come from authenticated state, and the marker needs
  integrity protection (restrictive ownership, or a MAC) before it is authorization
  rather than a consistency check against a misderived target.
- **Returning a path leaves a check/use race.** Where an untrusted process can swap an
  ancestor between the check and the call, operate on a descriptor with no-follow,
  beneath-the-root semantics, or guarantee the hierarchy is immutable for the duration.

## Security Headers

If header policy is changed, check the required protection and affected integrations. This example is not a literal configuration to apply to every service; preserve established policy unless a supported change is authorized.

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 0  (disabled, rely on CSP)
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

## CORS Configuration

For changed cross-origin access, retain the intended public/private boundary and credential policy. The restricted-origin example below applies to a private/credentialed API; it is not a reason to change an intentionally public unauthenticated resource.

```typescript
// Restrictive (recommended)
cors({
  origin: ['https://yourdomain.com', 'https://app.yourdomain.com'],
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
})

// Do not use a wildcard as the policy for a private/credentialed API:
cors({ origin: '*' })  // Allows any origin; not a substitute for authorization
```

## Data Protection

Apply to affected sensitive data paths and actual retention/compliance requirements. Do not read, export or mutate real data to fill this checklist without applicable authority.

- [ ] Sensitive fields excluded from API responses (`passwordHash`, `resetToken`, etc.)
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged (passwords, tokens, full CC numbers)
- [ ] PII encrypted at rest (if required by regulation)
- [ ] HTTPS for all external communication
- [ ] Database backups encrypted
- [ ] Personal data is classified, collected against a stated purpose, and minimized
- [ ] Personal data has a retention limit and a working deletion path (incl. backups, caches, indexes)
- [ ] Export/delete (data-subject) requests are supported where required; third-party sharing has consent and a data-processing agreement

## Dependency Security

For dependency changes, audits or authorized installation, first locate the **installation boundary**. An unrelated source edit does not require reinstalling or auditing the whole dependency graph. If the package is matched by a parent `workspaces` declaration, use that workspace root; otherwise use the nearest project root that owns both its manifest and dependency graph. At that boundary, corroborate `packageManager` (when present), the lockfile, and CI commands. Resolve conflicts before the affected install if these disagree or competing manager lockfiles exist there; continue independent source work. A nested project is independent only when it is outside the parent workspace; independent subprojects may legitimately use different managers.

| Manager/version signal | Frozen/immutable CI install | Known-advisory audit |
|---|---|---|
| npm (`package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json`) | `npm ci` | `npm audit` |
| pnpm | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | `pnpm audit` |
| Yarn 2+ | `yarn install --immutable` | `yarn npm audit -A -R` |
| Yarn 1 | `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` | `yarn audit` |

For an unlisted manager or version, consult its official documentation; do not substitute another manager's commands or newer defaults.

### Install-Script Gate

When installation is in scope, do not discover dependency lifecycle scripts by first executing an ordinary install on a client whose defaults have not been verified. Existing valid dependency evidence can be reused; this section does not create an installation requirement for every task.

1. Bootstrap with dependency scripts disabled, or with a documented default-deny policy plus fail-closed enforcement.
2. Inspect the exact script source and package version before approval.
3. Within authorized installation scope, record the narrowest native allow/deny policy at the installation boundary in the working tree. Local verification does not require a commit; stage/commit/push only under explicit Git authority.
4. Run an authorized clean frozen/immutable install with that policy and verify the required packages still build.

**Point-in-time snapshot:** Package-manager defaults and command names change quickly. Verify this matrix against the pinned client's current official documentation before relying on it.

| Manager version | Native policy |
|---|---|
| npm without verified granular approvals | Bootstrap with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, or persist `ignore-scripts=true` when project-wide blocking is intended. Keep scripts disabled or deliberately upgrade before allowing any reviewed dependency script. |
| npm 11.18.x (verified on 11.18.0) | Unreviewed dependency scripts run with a warning by default. Enforce `strict-allow-scripts=true` before a normal install, then use the workspace-unaware `npm install-scripts ls` from the installation boundary; keep approvals version-pinned and denials name-wide. |
| npm 12.x (verified on 12.0.1) | Unreviewed dependency scripts are skipped by default; `strict-allow-scripts=true` makes their presence fail the install before execution. Use the same `npm install-scripts` review and approval flow. |
| pnpm 11+ | Use `pnpm approve-builds` and persist `allowBuilds` decisions in the working tree before verification; `strictDepBuilds` defaults to `true`, so unreviewed builds fail. |
| pnpm 10.26–10.x | Configure `allowBuilds` explicitly, or use `pnpm approve-builds` with the legacy `onlyBuiltDependencies` / `ignoredBuiltDependencies` lists. Set `strictDepBuilds: true`; its v10 default is `false`. |
| pnpm 10.1–10.25 | `pnpm approve-builds` records the legacy lists; enable `strictDepBuilds` where supported (10.3+). |
| Older or unknown pnpm | Bootstrap with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`. Keep scripts disabled unless the pinned version documents an enforceable policy. |
| Yarn 4.14+ | Dependency postinstalls are disabled by default. Grant only required exceptions with top-level `dependenciesMeta.<package>.built: true`. |
| Yarn 2–4.13 | Set `enableScripts: false` in `.yarnrc.yml`, then grant only required exceptions with top-level `dependenciesMeta.<package>.built: true`; do not enable scripts globally. |
| Yarn 1 | Bootstrap with `yarn install --ignore-scripts`; keep scripts disabled unless each required exception is reviewed under the pinned client's documented workflow. |

Authoritative checks: [npm install-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-install-scripts/), [install policy](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-install/), and [CLI releases](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases); [pnpm approve-builds](https://pnpm.io/cli/approve-builds) and [build settings](https://pnpm.io/settings#allowbuilds); [Yarn security](https://yarnpkg.com/features/security) and [manifest](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#dependenciesMeta).

**Supply-chain hygiene** (advisory audits do not catch newly malicious packages):
- [ ] Exactly one authoritative lockfile per project/workspace root is maintained with the change and CI never rewrites it; committing is a separate authorized delivery action
- [ ] Critical/high findings are triaged for reachability; deferrals have a reason and review date
- [ ] Forced audit remediation (`npm audit fix --force` or equivalent) is never automatic; remediation diffs and changelogs are reviewed
- [ ] Registry signatures/provenance are verified where the manager supports it
- [ ] Dependency lifecycle scripts are blocked before first execution and approved only through the pinned manager's native policy
- [ ] New dependencies are reviewed for ownership, maintenance, release age, provenance, transitive graph, and typosquatting

## AI / LLM Security

For changed LLM/tool/data boundaries (chatbots, summarizers, agents, RAG), select the applicable controls:

- [ ] Model output treated as untrusted — never into `eval`/SQL/shell/`innerHTML`/file paths
- [ ] Prompt injection assumed; permissions enforced in code, not in the system prompt
- [ ] Secrets, cross-tenant data, and full system prompts kept out of the context window
- [ ] Tool/agent permissions scoped; destructive or irreversible actions require applicable human authority, without repeating confirmation for scope already explicitly granted
- [ ] Token, rate, and recursion/loop limits set (bound consumption)

## Error Handling

```typescript
// Production: generic error, no internals
res.status(500).json({
  error: { code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR', message: 'Something went wrong' }
});

// NEVER in production:
res.status(500).json({
  error: err.message,
  stack: err.stack,         // Exposes internals
  query: err.sql,           // Exposes database details
});
```

| LLM07 | System Prompt Leakage | Assume the system prompt can leak; put no secrets in it |
| LLM08 | Vector and Embedding Weaknesses | Partition RAG embeddings per tenant; validate documents before indexing |
| LLM09 | Misinformation | Ground answers with citations; validate critical claims; keep a human in the loop |
| LLM10 | Unbounded Consumption | Cap tokens, request rate, and loop/recursion depth |
